## Battery Notification Bash Script üêß

This script helps manage your laptop's battery by notifying you when it is fully charged (100%) and when it reaches a low level (20%). This way, you can prevent overcharging and ensure your laptop doesn't shut down due to low battery. The script is designed for Linux systems, and I have tested it on Ubuntu 23.04.

# Installation

## Run the setup script
To install the battery notifier, execute the following command:
bash 
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhruvmistry2000/Battery_Notifier/refs/heads/main/setup.sh | bash
```
This command will set up the script for you automatically.
