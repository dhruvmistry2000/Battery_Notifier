## Battery Notification Bash Script üêß

This script helps manage your laptop's battery by notifying you when it is fully charged (100%) and when it reaches a low level (20%). This way, you can prevent overcharging and ensure your laptop doesn't shut down due to low battery. The script is designed for Linux systems.
